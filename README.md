# kbpcb
This is a fork of https://github.com/fcoury/kbpcb

This fork adds/fixes the following:
1. There was a typo in the KiCAD project generated by the original project 
    which breaks the schematic <--> pcb update on KiCAD
2. All components are given an id ending in a number such as 'K_Space0', 
    without this KiCAD tries to auto-annotate the schematic which, again breaks PCB <-> Schematic sync.
3. The smallest possible matrix size is used -- I might give a commandline option for that
4. Introduces a `cmd.js` utility file for running kbpcb off command line. I'll rename that to `kbpcb.js` one of these commits.
